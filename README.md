# SwaGenPG
SwaGenPG reads your PostgreSQL database and generates Swagger/OpenAPI YAML from table meta data. This results in a boilerplate swaggerfile (YML) that should probably be edited to completely suit your needs. Use [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) or [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) to generate the API boilerplate Go code.

## Swagger version
SwaGenPG generates Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 configuration.

## Installation
SwaGenPG can be acquired and installed by running

```
go get -v -u github.com/minitauros/SwaGenPG
```

## How to build
Or, alternatively, the binary can be manually built:

```
go build -o ~/bin/SwaGenPG main.go
```

## Usage

### Creating a config file
You will need to create a small config file that SwaGenPG uses to generate YML. For example:

```
db:
  host: 192.168.1.1
  port: 5432
  user: postgres
  password: password
  dbname: db1
  schema: public

service:
  name: MyService
  host: 127.0.0.1:1234

resources:
  table_name:
    # The written name of the resource, e.g. "product". Will be used in summaries.
    title: written name of resource
    definition:
      # This is how the resource will be named in the definitions list.
      name: ResourceDefinition
  # Continue listing all the tables you want to generate Swagger YAML for.
```

### Running SwaGenPG
Swagger YML can then be generated using the following command:

```
SwaGenPG -conf=conf.yml > swagger.yml
```

### Example
Products table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
); 
```

Config:

```
db:
  host: 192.168.1.1
  port: 5432
  user: postgres
  password: password
  dbname: db1
  schema: public


service:
  name: TestService
  host: 1.1.1.1:1234

resources:
  products:
    title: product
    definition:
      name: Product
```

Result:

## Tests
This package does not contain tests. Since it would be foolish to run this directly in any production environment, I will assume that every time this tool might be used, the person using it will check and modify the output (as the tool attow only generates boilerplate YML). On top of that, if invalid YML is generated, other tools (like swagger-codegen) will break, also spotting any defects.
